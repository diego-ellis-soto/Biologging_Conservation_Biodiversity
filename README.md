# Biologging_Conservation_Biodiversity

Repository for recreating figures from Ellis-Soto et al. From bio-logging to conservation: tracking individual performance in changing environments

This repository serves as a resource to recreate global maps of animal telemetry deployment, and provide additional information for additional Figures.

Figure_1_environmental_context_stork.R: Plot White stork remote sensing variables. Make close up figures with mapshot

Figure_1_wilma_breeding_ndvi.js : Google Earth Engine Code to get NDVI values for Wilma the white stork

Figure_2_plot_global_layers.R: Make plots for global maps of human footprint, forest fragmentation, conservation priority areas (for Figure 2)

Figure_2_plot_movebank_deployment.R : Make a global map of Movebank deployments (for Figure 2)

histogram.R: Estimate the global distribution of animal telemetry studies on Movebank across anthropogenic and environmental space. (for Figure 2)
